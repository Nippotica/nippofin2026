## The Innovator 


[Larry Richards-Ando](https://www.linkedin.com/in/larrybrichards/) spent decades translating algorithms into executable code at scale. After leading infrastructure teams at NEC, Ericsson, and Alcatel-Lucent across Asia, he pivoted to quantitative finance—founding Iota Technologies and serving as CTO of Gammon Capital, where he built option trading systems that actually worked. At SMBC Nikko Securities, he developed hedging algorithms for Treasury positions and taught derivatives traders applied machine learning. 

Fluent in Japanese with deep expertise in predictive modeling and numerical methods, he bridges quantitative sophistication with execution discipline—understanding that elegant code means nothing if it can't survive market turbulence.

Larry is the developer of [Vollib](https://vollib.org/), a Python library that builds on [Peter Jäckel’s Let’s Be Rational](http://www.jaeckel.org/LetsBeRational.pdf) algorithm to efficiently compute option prices, implied volatility, and greeks.
