## The Marketer 

[Tsuyoshi Hatao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tsuyoshi-hatao-52535727/) brings 29 years of financial services expertise—from structuring derivatives at Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan to leading BlackRock's Aladdin Wealth Tech in Japan. He understands both sides of the equation: the quantitative rigor of risk analytics and the strategic realities of selling solutions to Japanese institutional clients. With a Master's in Computational and Applied Mathematics from University of Tokyo, he combines deep technical knowledge with practical business insight—knowing what works in Japan's financial services market and why. 

Now as CMO of Nippotica Corporation, he translates that experience into impactful go-to-market strategies.
