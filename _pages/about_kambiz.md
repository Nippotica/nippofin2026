## The Strategist 

[Kambiz Homayounfar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kambiz-homayounfar-b379a01ba/) has spent four decades building and selling deep tech solutions. He founded three successful ventures—Algorex (acquired by National Semiconductor), Genista (acquired by Symmetricom), and Phybit (private equity exit)—signing global clients from AT&T to Sony along the way. His expertise spans signal computing, parallel computing, and computational vision, with multiple patents in high-performance systems. 

Today as Chief Strategy Officer of Nippotica and CEO of Algotechniq, he applies this technical depth to building AI-powered solutions for Japanese institutional clients, translating  algorithms into systems that are simple enough to buy, complex enough to matter.
